> Docker is required — see [official installation docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) for platform-specific instructions.


## AI Models

On first launch, the `gemma3:4b` model (~3-4 GB) is automatically downloaded and configured for use in n8n LLM workflows.

To install additional Ollama models, **launch the app first**, then run:

```bash
docker exec -it n8n-local-desktop-ollama-1 ollama pull <model-name>
```

For example:
```bash
docker exec -it n8n-local-desktop-ollama-1 ollama pull llama3.2:3b
```

Browse available models at [ollama.com/library](https://ollama.com/library).

## Connecting to Host LLM Servers

You can use LLM servers running directly on your machine, such as [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/), [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) server, or a host-installed [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) instance, alongside or instead of the built-in Ollama container.

See [docs/host-llm-servers.md](docs/host-llm-servers.md) for setup instructions.

## Roadmap

- [x] Make it possible to connect with the host machine's LLM servers from n8n workflows, e.g. LM Studio, llama.cpp, Ollama, etc.
- [ ] Integrate n8n routes into the app menu
- [ ] Add an About page with app version info
- [ ] Make it possible to install new models via the app (currently only available via CLI)
