## AI Models

On first launch, the `gemma3:4b` model (~3-4 GB) is automatically downloaded and configured for use in n8n LLM workflows.

To install additional Ollama models, **launch the app first**, then run:

```bash
docker exec -it n8n-local-desktop-ollama-1 ollama pull <model-name>
```

For example:
```bash
docker exec -it n8n-local-desktop-ollama-1 ollama pull llama3.2:3b
```

Browse available models at [ollama.com/library](https://ollama.com/library).

## Roadmap

- [ ] Integrate n8n routes into the app menu  
- [ ] Add an About page with app version info  
- [ ] Make it possible to install new models via the app (currently only available via CLI)
