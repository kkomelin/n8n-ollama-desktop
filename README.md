**[🚀 Download for your OS](https://github.com/kkomelin/n8n-local-desktop/releases)**

> Docker is required - see [official installation docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) for platform-specific instructions.


## Why Use This?

- **No cloud, no subscriptions** - run n8n and local AI models entirely on your machine, free of charge
- **Privacy by default** - your workflows and data never leave your computer
- **One-click setup** - no manual Docker commands, no config files to edit; just [download](https://github.com/kkomelin/n8n-local-desktop/releases) and run
- **Local LLMs included** - ships with Ollama pre-configured, so AI-powered workflows work out of the box
- **Use your own models** - pull any model from Ollama's library or connect to LM Studio, llama.cpp, or a host Ollama instance
- **Full community edition** - runs the official n8n Docker image with no integrations removed or disabled

## AI Models

On first launch, the `llama3.2:3b` model (~2 GB) is automatically downloaded and configured for use in n8n LLM workflows.

To install additional Ollama models, use **Tools > Models** menu.

Alternatively, you can [install models via CLI](docs/models.md).

## Connecting to Host LLM Servers

You can use LLM servers running directly on your machine, such as [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/), [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) server, or a host-installed [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) instance, alongside or instead of the built-in Ollama container.

See [docs/host-llm-servers.md](docs/host-llm-servers.md) for setup instructions.

## Roadmap

- [x] Make it possible to connect with the host machine's LLM servers from n8n workflows, e.g. LM Studio, llama.cpp, Ollama, etc.
- [x] Add an About page with app version info
- [x] Make it possible to install new models via the app menu (Tools > Models)
- [ ] [YOUR IDEA](https://github.com/kkomelin/n8n-local-desktop/issues/new)
